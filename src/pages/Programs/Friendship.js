                    <h2>Best Buddies Friendship Program</h2>
                    <p>The Best Buddies Friendship program represent one of our organizationâ€™s three key mission pillars.  These programs build one-to-one friendships between people with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities, offering social interactions while improving the quality of life and level of inclusion for a population that is often isolated and excluded. Through their participation, people of determination form meaningful connections with their peers, gain self-confidence and self-esteem, and share interests, experiences and activities that many other individuals enjoy.</p>
