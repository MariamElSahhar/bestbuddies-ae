						<h2>Best Buddies Friendship Program</h2>
						<p>
							The Best Buddies Friendship program represent one of
							our organizationâ€™s three key mission pillars. These
							programs build one-to-one friendships between people
							with and without intellectual and developmental
							disabilities, offering social interactions while
							improving the quality of life and level of inclusion
							for a population that is often isolated and
							excluded. Through their participation, people of
							determination form meaningful connections with their
							peers, gain self-confidence and self-esteem, and
							share interests, experiences and activities that
							many other individuals enjoy.
